            <p>
                I love you more than words can express. You are my everything, my soulmate and my best friend. You bring so much light into my life and I am grateful to be someone you loved. Your smile warms my heart and your touch sends shivers down my spine. I cherish every laugh, sad, mad and everything else. You are the one I want to spend my life with, through thick and thin, through ups and downs. I love you today more than yesterday. Remember if you're a goddess and you're my rockstar.<br>
